# Task ID: 1
# Title: Setup Next.js 15 Project with TypeScript
# Status: in-progress
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: high
# Description: Initialize the project with Next.js 15 and TypeScript, including necessary configurations and folder structure, with comprehensive testing and quality assurance workflows.
# Details:
Use create-next-app to set up a new Next.js 15 project with TypeScript. Configure tsconfig.json for strict type checking. Set up ESLint and Prettier for code quality. Initialize Git repository with semantic versioning commit standards. Install dependencies: React 18, TypeScript 5.1+, @types/react, @types/node, Vitest, Playwright. Create basic folder structure: pages/, components/, styles/, lib/, types/, hooks/, tests/. Implement quality gates to ensure code meets standards. Set up test coverage monitoring to maintain 80% coverage. Create task completion reporting mechanism.

# Test Strategy:
Verify project structure, run TypeScript compiler to check for errors, ensure all scripts (dev, build, start) work correctly. Run Vitest for unit and integration tests with 80% coverage requirement. Execute Playwright tests for end-to-end testing. Verify ESLint/Prettier compliance. Include manual testing instructions for key functionality.

Modify next.config.js file to include necessary build options, and set up deployment configuration for your chosen hosting platform

## 7. Set up Vitest for unit and integration testing [pending]
### Dependencies: 1.1, 1.2
### Description: Configure Vitest for comprehensive unit and integration testing
### Details:
Install Vitest and related dependencies. Create vitest.config.ts file. Set up test directory structure with appropriate helpers and mocks. Configure coverage reporting to ensure 80% code coverage requirement.

## 8. Set up Playwright for end-to-end testing [pending]
### Dependencies: 1.1, 1.2
### Description: Configure Playwright for comprehensive end-to-end testing
### Details:
Install Playwright and related dependencies. Create playwright.config.ts file. Set up e2e test directory with appropriate test scenarios. Configure CI integration for automated testing.

## 9. Configure Git with semantic versioning [pending]
### Dependencies: 1.1
### Description: Set up Git repository with semantic versioning commit standards
### Details:
Initialize Git repository. Install commitlint and husky. Configure commit message format to follow semantic versioning (feat, fix, chore, etc.). Set up pre-commit and pre-push hooks for quality gates.

## 10. Create quality gates workflow [pending]
### Dependencies: 1.2, 1.3, 1.4, 1.7, 1.8, 1.9
### Description: Implement quality gates to ensure code meets standards
### Details:
Create a quality gates workflow that checks: TypeScript strict mode compliance, ESLint/Prettier compliance, test coverage minimum of 80%, and successful test runs. Configure to run on pre-commit and/or CI pipeline.

## 11. Create manual testing instructions [pending]
### Dependencies: 1.1, 1.2, 1.3, 1.4, 1.5, 1.6, 1.7, 1.8
### Description: Develop comprehensive manual testing instructions for key functionality
### Details:
