# Title: Setup Next.js 15 Project with TypeScript
# Status: done
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: high
# Description: Initialize the project with Next.js 15 and TypeScript, including necessary configurations and folder structure, with comprehensive testing and quality assurance workflows.
# Details:
Use create-next-app to set up a new Next.js 15 project with TypeScript. Configure tsconfig.json for strict type checking. Set up ESLint and Prettier for code quality. Initialize Git repository with semantic versioning commit standards. Install dependencies: React 18, TypeScript 5.1+, @types/react, @types/node, Vitest, Playwright. Create basic folder structure: pages/, components/, styles/, lib/, types/, hooks/, tests/. Implement quality gates to ensure code meets standards. Set up test coverage monitoring to maintain 80% coverage. Create task completion reporting mechanism.

# Test Strategy:
Verify project structure, run TypeScript compiler to check for errors, ensure all scripts (dev, build, start) work correctly. Run Vitest for unit and integration tests with 80% coverage requirement.
