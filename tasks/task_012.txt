# Title: Optimize Performance and Implement Progressive Enhancement
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 8, 9, 10, 11
# Priority: medium
# Description: Optimize application performance and implement progressive enhancement techniques.
# Details:
Implement code splitting using Next.js dynamic imports. Optimize images using next/image. Implement virtualization for large tables using react-window (v1.8+). Use Web Workers for heavy computations. Implement skeleton loaders for better perceived performance. Ensure proper error boundaries and fallback UI. Optimize React rendering using useMemo and useCallback hooks.

# Test Strategy:
Conduct performance profiling using Chrome DevTools. Measure and optimize Core Web Vitals. Test application behavior with slow network conditions.
