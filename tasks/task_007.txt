# Priority: high
# Description: Implement a global filtering system with AND logic and persistence across tabs.
# Details:
Create a FilterStore using Zustand. Implement filter categories: date range, Sub2/Landing ID, Source, OS Family, Currency, Player Status. Use react-datepicker (v4.12+) for date range selection. Implement multi-select functionality for applicable filters. Create utility functions for applying filters to data. Ensure filter persistence across tab navigation.

# Test Strategy:
Write unit tests for filter logic. Test filter application on sample datasets. Verify filter persistence across tab navigation.
