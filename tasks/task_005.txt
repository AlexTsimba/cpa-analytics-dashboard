# Task ID: 5
# Title: Implement State Management with Zustand and XState
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 1, 2
# Priority: high
# Description: Set up Zustand for global state management and XState for UI state machines.
# Details:
Install Zustand (v4.3+) and XState (v4.37+). Create a root store with Zustand for global app state. Implement separate stores for filters, data, and UI state. Create XState machines for async operations (data fetching, processing, chart rendering). Integrate XState with React components using useMachine hook. Implement persistence for filter state across tabs.

# Test Strategy:
Write unit tests for Zustand stores and XState machines. Test state transitions and ensure correct behavior in various scenarios.
