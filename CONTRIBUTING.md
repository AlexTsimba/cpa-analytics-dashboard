### React Components

- Use functional components with hooks
- Follow the single responsibility principle
- Use descriptive component and prop names
- Implement proper error boundaries

### Code Style

- Follow ESLint and Prettier configurations
- Use meaningful variable and function names
- Write self-documenting code with clear comments
- Keep functions small and focused

### File Organization
