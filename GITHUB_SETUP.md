# 🚀 GitHub Repository Setup Instructions

This project is ready for publication on GitHub. Follow these steps to create and publish the repository.

## 📋 Prerequisites

- GitHub account
- Git configured locally (already done ✅)
- Project code quality verified (all checks passing ✅)

## 🔧 Step 1: Create GitHub Repository

### Option A: Using GitHub Web Interface

1. Go to [GitHub](https://github.com) and sign in
2. Click the "+" icon in the top right corner
3. Select "New repository"
4. Configure the repository:
   - **Repository name**: `cpa-analytics-dashboard`
   - **Description**: `Modern CPA analytics dashboard built with Next.js 15, TypeScript, and comprehensive testing`
   - **Visibility**: Choose Public or Private
   - **Do NOT** initialize with README, .gitignore, or license (we already have these)
5. Click "Create repository"

### Option B: Using GitHub CLI (if available)

```bash
# Create repository
gh repo create cpa-analytics-dashboard --description "Modern CPA analytics dashboard built with Next.js 15, TypeScript, and comprehensive testing" --public
```

## 🔗 Step 2: Connect Local Repository to GitHub

After creating the repository on GitHub, you'll get a URL like:
`https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/cpa-analytics-dashboard.git`

Run these commands in your project directory:

```bash
# Add remote origin
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/cpa-analytics-dashboard.git

# Verify remote was added
git remote -v

# Push code to GitHub
git push -u origin master
```

## 🏷️ Step 3: Create Initial Release Tag

```bash
# Create and push a release tag
git tag -a v0.1.0 -m "Initial release with Playwright E2E testing setup"
git push origin v0.1.0
```

## 📝 Step 4: Update Repository Settings

1. Go to your repository on GitHub
2. Click on "Settings" tab
3. Configure the following:

### 🔒 Branch Protection

- Go to "Branches" section
- Add rule for `master` branch:
  - ✅ Require status checks to pass before merging
  - ✅ Require branches to be up to date before merging
  - ✅ Require linear history
  - ✅ Do not allow force pushes
  - ✅ Do not allow deletions

### 🎯 GitHub Pages (Optional)

- Go to "Pages" section
- Source: Deploy from a branch
- Branch: master / (root)
- This will create a demo site (requires build configuration)

### 🏷️ Topics/Tags

Add these topics to help with discovery:

- `nextjs`
- `typescript`
- `react`
- `tailwindcss`
- `playwright`
- `analytics`
- `dashboard`
- `cpa`
- `testing`

## 🔄 Step 5: Set Up GitHub Actions (Optional)

Create `.github/workflows/ci.yml` for automated testing:

```yaml
name: CI

on:
  push:
    branches: [master]
  pull_request:
    branches: [master]

jobs:
  quality:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4

      - name: Setup Node.js
        uses: actions/setup-node@v4
        with:
          node-version: '18'
          cache: 'npm'

      - name: Install dependencies
        run: npm ci

      - name: Run quality checks
        run: npm run quality

      - name: Build project
        run: npm run build

      - name: Run E2E tests
        run: npm run test:e2e
```

## 📊 Step 6: Add Repository Badges

Add these badges to your README.md:

```markdown
[![CI](https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/cpa-analytics-dashboard/workflows/CI/badge.svg)](https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/cpa-analytics-dashboard/actions)
[![TypeScript](https://img.shields.io/badge/TypeScript-Ready-blue.svg)](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)
