# Quality Gates Documentation

## üìã Overview

The Quality Gates system provides comprehensive verification of code quality, testing, security, and performance standards. This ensures that only high-quality code reaches production and maintains consistent development standards across the team.

## üéØ Quality Standards

### Code Quality

- **TypeScript**: Strict mode compilation with zero errors
- **ESLint**: Zero warnings policy with strict rules
- **Prettier**: Consistent code formatting enforcement
- **Import Organization**: Clean, organized imports with no unused dependencies

### Testing Requirements

- **Unit Tests**: Minimum 80% code coverage
- **Integration Tests**: All critical paths covered
- **E2E Tests**: Complete user flows verified
- **Test Quality**: Meaningful assertions and proper mocking

### Build Standards

- **Clean Builds**: No build warnings or errors
- **Bundle Size**: Optimized bundle sizes under thresholds
- **Performance**: Tree-shaking and optimization verified
- **Environment**: Multi-environment build validation

### Security Standards

- **Dependency Audit**: No high/critical vulnerabilities
- **Code Analysis**: Static security analysis (CodeQL)
- **Secrets**: No hardcoded secrets or sensitive data
- **Environment**: Secure environment variable management

### Git Workflow

- **Conventional Commits**: Semantic versioning compliance
- **Branch Strategy**: Protected branch policies
- **Code Review**: Required approvals for protected branches
- **History**: Clean, linear commit history

## üéÆ Automation

### Pre-Commit Hooks

Automatically run on `git commit`:

- TypeScript compilation
- ESLint validation
- Prettier formatting
- Related test execution
- Quick build verification (for src changes)

### Pre-Push Hooks

Automatically run on `git push`:

- **Protected Branches** (main/master/develop):
  - Full quality gates suite
  - Complete test coverage
  - Production build verification
- **Feature Branches**:
  - Standard quality checks
  - Basic validation

### GitHub Actions

Automatically triggered on push/PR:

- Comprehensive quality gates
- Multi-OS/Node version matrix
- Security scanning (CodeQL, Snyk)
- Lighthouse performance testing
- Commit status updates

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration

### Quality Gates Config (`.quality-gates.json`)

```json
{
  "qualityGates": {
    "coverage": { "threshold": 80 },
    "linting": { "maxWarnings": 0 },
    "security": { "auditLevel": "moderate" },
    "performance": {
      "lighthouse": { "performance": 90 }
    }
  }
}
```

### NPM Scripts Integration

All quality gates are integrated into package.json scripts for easy access and CI/CD integration.

## üìà Reporting

### Console Output

- Color-coded status indicators
- Detailed failure explanations
- Progress tracking
- Summary statistics

### CI/CD Integration

- GitHub commit status updates
- PR comments with results
- Artifact generation
- Quality trend tracking

### Quality Metrics

- Success/failure rates
- Performance trends
- Coverage progression
- Security posture

## üö® Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### TypeScript Errors

```bash
# Check compilation
npm run type-check

# Common fixes
- Update type definitions
- Fix type annotations
- Check tsconfig.json
```

#### Linting Failures

```bash
# Auto-fix issues
npm run lint:fix

# Manual review
npm run lint:strict
```

#### Test Failures

```bash
# Run specific tests
npm run test -- tests/specific.test.ts

# Update snapshots
npm run test -- --update-snapshots

# Coverage details
npm run test:coverage
```

#### Build Issues

```bash
# Clean rebuild
rm -rf .next node_modules
npm install
npm run build
```

### Quality Gate Failures

#### Failed Checks Resolution

1. **Review Error Output**: Check detailed error messages
2. **Run Individual Checks**: Use category-specific commands
3. **Fix Issues Incrementally**: Address one category at a time
4. **Verify Fixes**: Re-run quality gates after fixes

#### Emergency Bypasses

For critical hotfixes only:

```bash
# Skip pre-commit (NOT RECOMMENDED)
git commit --no-verify

# Skip pre-push (NOT RECOMMENDED)
git push --no-verify
```

## üéØ Best Practices

### Development Workflow

1. Run `npm run quality:gates` before committing
2. Address all quality issues before pushing
3. Use category-specific checks for faster iteration
4. Monitor quality trends over time

### Team Standards

- Zero tolerance for quality gate failures on protected branches
- Regular quality gate updates and improvements
- Team education on quality standards
- Consistent enforcement across all environments

### Performance Optimization

- Use category-specific checks during development
- Run full suite before major commits
- Optimize test execution for faster feedback
- Cache quality check results where appropriate

## üìö Integration Examples

### VS Code Integration

Add to `.vscode/tasks.json`:

```json
{
  "label": "Quality Gates",
  "type": "shell",
  "command": "npm run quality:gates",
  "group": "test"
}
```

### Docker Integration

```dockerfile
RUN npm run quality:gates
```

### Makefile Integration

```makefile
quality:
	npm run quality:gates

.PHONY: quality
```

## üîÑ Continuous Improvement

The quality gates system is designed to evolve with the project:

- Regular threshold adjustments
- New quality metrics addition
- Performance optimization
- Team feedback integration

This ensures that quality standards grow with the project complexity and team expertise.
